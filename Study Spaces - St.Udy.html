                        <p>The Main Library is the place to go if you want access to the largest amount of resources; it offers both silent study spaces, private study rooms to conduct group work, and social areas. It also holds the most resources in terms of books, journals, videos, and periodicals out of any other building in St Andrews; and the Library Staff are always more than happy to help you find a particular source for your project. </p>

            <p>If you are looking for a more aesthetically pleasing place to revise, with natural lighting you should check out the King James Library. However, be sure to get here early as seats fill up quickly, and people often stay all day. </p>

            <p>Not many know about the library directly across from St Salvador's quad which is held in an old church, with stained glass lighting, and heaters under the desks. The Richardson Research Library at Martyrs Kirk is the perfect place for Postgrads and Masters students to hit the books. Unfortunately for undergraduates you can only get access into this library with a Postgrad/Masters Matriculation card.  </p>

            <p> This Museum located in the Bute Building has a plethora of taxidermic animals to admire, and there are also tables in the large open museum lobby for students to work. An inspiring place for Biologist to work, and never very busy, so when revision hits and the library is full at 12pm, this is a great study space to check out! </p>
